# TriPod

**TriPod is photo sharing application where users can like, share, and comment on posts (Pods)**

This project was created to experiment with Redux and MongoDB. I was able to learn a lot about persistent states and state management within React. In addition, I was able to efficiently create and style components using Material UI!

Backend was deployed on a seperate repo which can be found here:
